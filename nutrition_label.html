<!--




Step 1
We've provided a basic HTML boilerplate for you.

Create an h1 element within your body element and give it the text Nutrition Facts.

Step 2Passed
Below your h1 element, add a p element with the text 8 servings per container.

Step 3Passed
Add a second p element with the text Serving size 2/3 cup (55g).

Step 4Passed
Within your head element, add a link element with the rel attribute set to stylesheet and the href attribute set to https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,800.

This will import the Open Sans font family, with the font weight values 400, 700, and 800.

Also add a link element to link your styles.css file.

Step 7Passed
Wrap your h1 and p elements in a div element. Give that div a class attribute set to label.

Step 16Passed
Lines can help separate and group important content, especially when space is limited.

Create a div element below your h1 element, and give it a class attribute set to divider.

Step 19Passed
Nutrition labels have a lot of bold text to draw attention to important information. Rather than targeting each element that needs to be bold, it is more efficient to use a class to apply the bold styling to every element.

Give your second p element a class attribute set to bold.

Step 21Passed
Give your h1 element a class attribute set to bold. This will make the text bold again.

Step 22Passed
Horizontal spacing between equally important elements can increase the readability of your text.

Wrap the text 2/3 cup (55g) in a span element.


Step 24
Wrap everything within the .label element in a new header element.
Step 26
Create a new div element below your header element, and give it a class attribute set to divider large.

Step 29
Create a new div below your .large element and give it a class attribute set to calories-info.

Step 30
Within your .calories-info element, create a div element. 
Give that div element a class attribute set to left-container. 
Within the newly created div element, create a h2 element with the text Amount per serving. 
Give the h2 element a class attribute set to bold small-text.

Step 33
Below your .small-text element, create a new p element with the text Calories. 
Also below the .left-container element, create a new span element with the text 230.

Step 38
Below your .calories-info element, add a div with the class attribute set to divider medium.

Step 43
After your last .divider element, create a p element and give it the text Total Fat 8g 10%. 
Wrap the text Total Fat in a span element with the class of bold. 
Wrap the text 10% in another span element with the class of bold. 
Finally, nest the Total Fat span element and the text 8g in an additional span element for alignment.

Step 44
Below your element with the Total Fat text, create a new p element with the text 
Saturated Fat 1g 5%. Wrap the 5% in a span with the class attribute set to bold. 
In this case this is enough to align the percentage to 5%.

Step 45
This new p element will need to be indented. Give it a class set to indent.

Step 48
The bottom borders under your % Daily Value * and Saturated Fat 1g 5% elements
 do not extend the full width of the label. Add no-divider to the class for these two elements.


Step 50
Now you will have to add separate dividers below your .no-divider elements.

Your first .no-divider element has a .divider after it. 
Create another .divider after your second .no-divider element.


Step 51
After your last .divider, create another p element with the text Trans Fat 0g. 
Italicize the word Trans by wrapping it in an i element. 
Give the new p element the class attribute set to indent no-divider. 
Wrap Trans Fat 0g in a span element for alignment.

Step 52
Create another .divider after your last p element.

Step 53
After your last .divider, create a new p element with the text Cholesterol 0mg 0%. 
Wrap the text Cholesterol in a span element, and give that span element the class of bold. 
Wrap the text 0% in another span element, with the class of bold. Finally, 
nest the Cholesterol span element and the text 0mg in an additional span element for alignment.

Step 54
Below your last p element, create another p element with the text Sodium 160mg 7%. 
Wrap the text Sodium in a span element with a class attribute set to bold. 
Wrap the 7% text in another span element with the class set to bold. 
Also add an additional span element around Sodium 160mg for aligning it correctly.

Step 55
Add another p element with the text Total Carbohydrate 37g 13%. 
Like before, use span elements to make the text Total Carbohydrate and 13% bold. 
Also add an additional span element to wrap the Total Carbohydrate 37g text in a span 
element so to have it aligned to the left, and 13% to the right.

Step 57
Create another p element after your last .divider, and give it the text Total Sugars 12g. 
Assign that p element the class values necessary to indent it and remove the bottom border. 
Then create another .divider below your new p element.

Step 58
The advantage to creating these dividers is that you can apply specific classes to style 
them individually. Add double-indent to the class for your last .divider.

Step 60
Below your .double-indent element, add a new p element with the text 
Includes 10g Added Sugars 20%. Your new p element should also be double indented, 
and have no bottom border. Use a span to make the 20% bold and right aligned.

Then create another divider after that p element.

Step 61
After your last divider, create another p element with the text Protein 3g. 
Use the necessary classes to remove the bottom border, and a span to make the Protein bold.

Following this element, create a large divider.

Step 62
Create another p element below your large divider. Give the p element the text Vitamin D 2mcg 10%.

The p element contains only text, you can wrap the percentage in a span element so that 
it is considered a separate entity from the rest of the text, and it's moved to the right.

Step 64
Create the final p element for your .daily-value section. Give it the text Potassium 235mg 6%. 
Align the 6% text to the right, and remove the bottom border of the p element.
