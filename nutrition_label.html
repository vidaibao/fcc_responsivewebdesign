Step 1
We've provided a basic HTML boilerplate for you.

Create an h1 element within your body element and give it the text Nutrition Facts.

Step 2Passed
Below your h1 element, add a p element with the text 8 servings per container.

Step 3Passed
Add a second p element with the text Serving size 2/3 cup (55g).

Step 4Passed
Within your head element, add a link element with the rel attribute set to stylesheet and the href attribute set to https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,800.

This will import the Open Sans font family, with the font weight values 400, 700, and 800.

Also add a link element to link your styles.css file.

Step 7Passed
Wrap your h1 and p elements in a div element. Give that div a class attribute set to label.

Step 16Passed
Lines can help separate and group important content, especially when space is limited.

Create a div element below your h1 element, and give it a class attribute set to divider.

Step 19Passed
Nutrition labels have a lot of bold text to draw attention to important information. Rather than targeting each element that needs to be bold, it is more efficient to use a class to apply the bold styling to every element.

Give your second p element a class attribute set to bold.

Step 21Passed
Give your h1 element a class attribute set to bold. This will make the text bold again.

Step 22Passed
Horizontal spacing between equally important elements can increase the readability of your text.

Wrap the text 2/3 cup (55g) in a span element.


Step 24
Wrap everything within the .label element in a new header element.
Step 26
Create a new div element below your header element, and give it a class attribute set to divider large.

Step 29
Create a new div below your .large element and give it a class attribute set to calories-info.

Step 30
Within your .calories-info element, create a div element. 
Give that div element a class attribute set to left-container. 
Within the newly created div element, create a h2 element with the text Amount per serving. 
Give the h2 element a class attribute set to bold small-text.

Step 33
Below your .small-text element, create a new p element with the text Calories. 
Also below the .left-container element, create a new span element with the text 230.

Step 38
Below your .calories-info element, add a div with the class attribute set to divider medium.

Step 43
After your last .divider element, create a p element and give it the text Total Fat 8g 10%. 
Wrap the text Total Fat in a span element with the class of bold. 
Wrap the text 10% in another span element with the class of bold. 
Finally, nest the Total Fat span element and the text 8g in an additional span element for alignment.

Step 44
Below your element with the Total Fat text, create a new p element with the text 
Saturated Fat 1g 5%. Wrap the 5% in a span with the class attribute set to bold. 
In this case this is enough to align the percentage to 5%.

Step 45
This new p element will need to be indented. Give it a class set to indent.

Step 48
The bottom borders under your % Daily Value * and Saturated Fat 1g 5% elements
 do not extend the full width of the label. Add no-divider to the class for these two elements.
